# Simulation of the Chamoli Debris Flow Using GeoClaw

This is the working repository for setup scripts and settings for modeling the
2021 Chamoli debris flow using GeoClaw and other similar codes.  As this is a
work in progress please excuse the possible inaccuracies, bugs and dust while we
figure out how to understand how to model this flow properly.
